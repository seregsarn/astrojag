# astrojag

A library of useful algorithms for roguelikes.

I wrote this library specifically to replace all the non-graphics stuff libtcod provides that I was using, so that I can write non-tcod graphical back-ends (e.g. ncurses et al) without having to import libtcod.

(Nothing against tcod in principle, I've used it in three different projects and it's nice. I just have trouble getting it to build anywhere and I don't like some of the APIs. So these are my versions of it all.)
